Increase off-peak train frequency for signalling tests to be done

Given the MRT disruptions caused by the signalling tests, perhaps SMRT should do the tests during off-peak hours by increasing the train frequency to simulate peak-hour services (Reveal details on economic cost of MRT disruptions; July 31).

By putting in more resources to do this, fewer passengers would be affected, and it would allow SMRT to manage any breakdowns better.

The effectiveness of the signals does not depend on passenger load but relates to train frequency instead, so why cause delays and waste resources during the morning and evening peak hours?

The project team should be service-friendly and consider the inconvenience to peak-hour passengers, such as misunderstandings between employees and employers when the former arrive late for work.
