SINGAPORE — Train services between Ang Mo Kio and Yishun MRT stations on the North-South Line were disrupted at about 1.55pm for about 25 minutes on Monday (Aug 2), after a female commuter climbed over the half-height platform screen doors at Yio Chu Kang station before walking on the tracks. 

The Singapore Police Force said in a statement on Monday that they had received a call for assistance at Yio Chu Kang MRT station at about 1.55pm over a female commuter who had been seen walking on the MRT tracks.

“The female commuter was subsequently brought to safety and apprehended under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act,” police said.

The police added that she was also arrested for criminal trespass. Investigations are ongoing.

In a Facebook post on Monday, public transport operator SMRT said that the police escorted the commuter back to the platform at around 2.10pm and she was not injured,
