Train operators fined $1.1m for series of safety breaches and service delays


02 Oct 2013

Train operators SMRT and SBS Transit have been fined a total of $1.1m for a series of safety breaches and delay in service.

A $1.1m fine was slapped on train operators SMRT and SBS Transit for breaches in safety and service delays in the past 10 months.

The bulk of the fine, $860,000, is to be paid by SMRT for a series of lapses, such as the trackside fire at Newton station on 13th February, failing to repair a corroded rail along the Circle Line, failure to properly safeguard workers' interests by exposing them to electrocution at the Ulu Pandan depot between November and Decembers last year etc.

SBS Transit was fined $250,000 for taking two and a half hours to evacuate 250 passengers stuck in a stalled train on the North-East Line (NEL) earlier in June. The procedure should not have taken longer than 30 minutes.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it will not penalise SBS Transit for the breakdown on NEL on 11th January that was caused by corroded U-bolts, giving the benefit of doubt that it may not have been possible to detect such defects visually.

The fines collected will be contributed to the Public Transport Fund, used to help needy families with their transport costs.
