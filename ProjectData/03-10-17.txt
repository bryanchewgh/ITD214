No student or parent can ‘plan ahead’ for MRT train breakdowns

I refer to the article, “No PSLE students affected by 3-hour train delay” (Sept 28).

In response to queries, the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) said that “no schools have informed SEAB that any candidates were affected by the train service disruption”, after the incident last Thursday morning, which was the first day of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

A spokesperson of the SEAB said that before the start of the national examinations, it had advised students to “plan for sufficient travel time” and reminded them “about the actions they should take if affected by train service disruptions”.

I find these comments insensitive and hardly useful in giving the children or their parents peace of mind.

Yes, no children were late for the examinations, but are they in the right state of mind to sit for the papers after having to find another mode of transport, constantly worrying that they’ll be late for their exam?

How can any child or parent “plan for sufficient travel time” when they do not know beforehand whether the MRT services will break down the morning of the PSLE?

SEAB made it sound like if the students are late, it is their fault because they were reminded beforehand, when what it should be doing is to assure the children that they are not to blame. Maybe it is not the board’s intent, but it definitely comes off that way.
