The East-West Line (EWL) experienced a three-hour delay due to a track fault at Jurong East MRT station on Jul. 4.

The fault occurred at the station at around 5am.

Services started progressively resuming at around 7:48am.

Bridging bus services available
Train operator SMRT announced the fault at 6:17am. It advised commuters to add 20 minutes of travel time between Buona Vista and Clementi, and subsequently between Boon Lay and Clementi.


Free regular bus services and bridging bus services were available to ferry passengers between Boon Lay and Clementi stations.

Passengers were also advised to take alternative lines such as the Thomson-East Coast Line, North-South Line and Downtown Line.

At 8:18am, SMRT announced that the fault had been cleared and train services progressively resumed from 7:48am.

The free regular and bridging bus services ceased at 8:12am.


Faulty point machine
The delays were a result of a "faulty point machine", said SMRT in a Facebook post.

"A point machine controls train movements at rail junctions when trains switch tracks. It is crucial for the point machine to be fully functional for the safe operation of trains," they added.

Once the fault was detected, trains were slowed down to 5 km/h for safety reasons, resulting in the delays.

SMRT said its staff were deployed onto the track to investigate the issue. Additional staff assisted service ambassadors in managing peak hour crowds.

"We apologise to all commuters who experienced longer travel times today."
