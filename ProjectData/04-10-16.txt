Downtown Line disrupted due to platform screen door fault

04 Oct 2016


Commuters tweeted that they had to wait up to 20 minutes for their train and large crowds were amassing along the line at stations like Bukit Panjang.

Service on the Downtown Line was disrupted on Tuesday, 4th October, morning due to a platform screen door fault, which occurred at Sixth Avenue station. A picture tweeted by a commuter showed a platform door being dislodged with cracked glass. Train service was halted between Sixth Avenue and King Albert Park stations and free buses were provided by SBS between Botanic Gardens and Beauty World stations.

The Ministry of Education said in a Facebook post that students taking exams who were caught in the breakdown should go to the nearest exam centre. An update from SBS indicated that train service on the Downtown Line has resumed since 8:25am and that free bus rides and bridging buses were still available at designated bus stops.

However, the affected platform screen door at Sixth Avenue station was not in operation even as trains pulled in and out of the station. In a media statement sent out at 10:49am, SBS Transit said the train service was disrupted at about 6:25am.

The Platform Screen Doors 9 and 10 on Platform B at the Sixth Avenue Station are currently not in operation, SBS Transit said, adding that work on repairing the platform screen door will be carried out after passenger service hours on Tuesday night. "We are investigating the cause of the Platform Screen Door fault with the Land Transport Authority and the contractor. We apologise to all affected commuters for the inconvenience caused," it said.
