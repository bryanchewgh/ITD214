Better MRT reliability even as major breakdowns increased last year


05 Apr 2016


Major MRT disruptions increased by 40 percent in 2015, but trains are travelling longer between delays, which indicates greater reliability.

There were 14 major breakdowns on the MRT network last year - an increase of 40 percent from the previous year, the Land Transport Authority announced on its website, reported The Straits Times. Meanwhile, the number of such breakdowns, each lasting more than 30 minutes, on the LRT system nearly quadrupled to 15.

For the MRT, only the newest line - the Downtown Line - posted a drop in the number of major disruptions. All others saw an increase, with the oldest - North-South and East-West lines - accounting for half the total of 14. As for the LRT system, the problematic Bukit Panjang LRT, which has broken down repeatedly since day one in 1999, chalked up 10 major incidents - up from two in 2014.

Despite the big breakdowns, the rail system was more reliable than it has been since 2011. Last year, a train clocked an average of 133,000km before a delay of more than five minutes occurred. This was up from 93,000km in 2014 and 58,000km in 2011.

Dr. Walter Theseira, an economist at SIM University, said, "The overall picture is that rail reliability is steadily improving. However, it's unfortunate that major breakdowns, which tend to inconvenience commuters to a much greater extent, have not improved in recent years. The question is whether we have put, or are putting in enough spending on maintenance to bring that probability of disruption down to an acceptably low level."
