Service disruption along BPLRT and CCL together on Monday morning

5 November 2018


Train service was disrupted along the Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT), and at about the same time along the Circle Line (CCL) on Monday (5 Nov) morning.

Commuters began experiencing delays around 7:30am on the BPLRT due to a system fault, followed by 10 minutes delay along the Circle Line on both directions caused by train fault. This information were obtained from commuters’ posts on social media platforms while SMRT remained silent with no official announcement on its media platforms.

Passengers asked for confirmation by the transport operator and information on Twitter:

@SMRT_Singapore is the BP LRT broken??

While another passenger wrote that Minister for Transport, Khaw Boon Wan, should not praise the Singapore’s rail network:

CCL starts from zero this morning. I think KBW should just not announce these things. https://t.co/1ZaLHVSpis

Yappies also questioned the so called ‘Real Time train service update’ from SMRT:

Thankfully, a few minutes later, commuters’ comments showed that the situation along the CCL was getting better:
