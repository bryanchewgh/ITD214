Train delays happen because of unforeseen or even foreseen circumstances. Huge crowds form quickly and transportation alternatives are unable to cope. Directing the crowds is a challenge, and often results in commuter frustration (“Multisectoral solution needed for MRT woes”; Dec 3).

Borrowing a procedure from the Singapore Civil Defence Force — mandatory fire drills for buildings conducted biannually — the authorities may want to consider having every train station conduct an evacuation drill.

Public and private buses for different routes would be activated within a stipulated time, crowd-control personnel would be mobilised and information would be disseminated through different channels.
