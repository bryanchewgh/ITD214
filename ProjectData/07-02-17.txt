There was no announcement on whether SMRT provided bus service during the disruption.
However, some of the announcements were contested by tweets from commuters who were experiencing the delay.
Vvampicilous stated that the trains were actually more than 30 minutes delay.
Weijie tweeted before SMRT’s first announcement that the trains stopped intermittently from Jurong East to Pioneer for more than 15 minutes.
Alex said that track fault was also affecting direction towards Pasir Ris and he asked SMRT to also announce it.
NYDC1978 asked SMRT to just call a breakdown as a breakdown. “Don’t call it track work,” she said.
While, many commuters asked SMRT on why it decided to do the track work during peak hour.
Shaz asked SMRT why almost all the train faults occur during the peak period as he never encountered any track fault off peak.
