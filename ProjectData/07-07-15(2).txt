“I am extremely concerned about today’s incident”: Lui Tuck Yew

7 July 2015

Transport Minister, Lui Tuck Yew, says he “is extremely concerned about today’s incident” with the train system where both the entire North-South and East-West lines were shut down due to a “power trip”.

The breakdown, which is reported to affect 250,000 commuters, happened at 7pm on Friday and is believed to be the worst incident in the system’s history, even surpassing the two incidents in December 2011.

Many have taken to social media to vent their frustrations about the incident.

As of 10pm, train service along the East-West line has been restored although the trains are running at a slower speed, says the Land Transport Authority.

The North-South line remains down.

Here was what Mr Lui posted on his Facebook page at about 10.15pm, Tuesday.
