New rail lines to provide more connectivity, improve network

When the four new MRT lines being built now are completed, commuters will face less inconvenience when there are breakdowns because they will have alternative options, said Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew yesterday.

Acknowledging that commuters in cities like London and New York are less inconvenienced despite facing more frequent train disruptions, Mr Lui said this is because their train networks have better connectivity.

“The new rail lines we are building will not only improve connectivity, but will also strengthen the overall resilience of the MRT network,” he said, at a preview of the new Gali Batu Depot yesterday, which is where the trains for the Downtown Line (DTL) will operate from starting in December.

Mr Lui said yesterday that DTL2’s 12 stations will open on Dec 27, with the entire line scheduled for completion in 2017. The Thomson-East Coast Line will also open progressively from 2019, while the Jurong Region Line will start operations around 2025. The Cross Island Line will start around 2030. By then, eight in 10 households will be a 10-minute walk from an MRT station, he noted.

“Our rail network will be one of the densest in the world,” he added. “With a more dense and interconnected network, commuters will have alternate routes in the event of a disruption.” Mr Lui also said the Cross Island Line, in particular, will be a “critical orbital line” as it will have connections with all existing MRT lines.
