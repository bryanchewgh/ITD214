Regular train services resumed on the Circle Line at around 11.30am after a signalling fault caused delays during morning rush hour on Feb 8.

Sharing a photo of a large crowd in Bishan MRT station on the Circle Line platform, Stomper W said the train service was down at 8.35am.



SMRT first posted about the delay on its socials at 8am: "Due to a signal fault, please add additional 10 minutes travel time between Stadium and Paya Lebar."

At 9.39am, it suggested commuters "consider alternative means of transport".


By 11.15am, SMRT said the delay was 20 minutes and affected travel times between Dhoby Ghaut, Marina Bay and Paya Lebar stations, adding that free regular bus service was available between those bus stations.

Netizens posted photos of long queues in Bishan and Buona Vista stations.


In a Facebook post, SMRT explained that a trackside signalling fault occurred between Stadium and Mountbatten stations at 5.45am.

"Train services remained available but were moving slower than usual for the safety of our commuters as our station staff had to operate the trains manually in the affected stretch," said the rail operator.

"Our engineers are working closely with Alstom to rectify the fault."

Alstom is the train manufacturer.

SMRT added: "We are sorry for affecting your morning commute."
