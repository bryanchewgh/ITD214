Talk about coincidences.

Possibly the worst MRT breakdown in Singapore's history -- when services on both the North-South and East-West Lines went down leaving an estimated 250,000 commuters stranded in the evening of July 7, 2015 -- coincidentally occurred on the exact same day as SMRT's 16th Annual General Meeting.

Here is a notice of the AGM posted on SMRT's website:

The AGM commenced at 2.30pm at the Raffles City Convention Centre well before the breakdown went into full swing.
