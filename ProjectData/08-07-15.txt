SMRT has issued an apology by their CEO Desmond Kuek in a letter that was made public some time after 12 midnight on July 8, 2015, several hours after services on both the North-South and East-West Lines went down in possibly the worst MRT breakdown Singapore has experienced.

It is estimated that about 250,000 commuters were affected.

The letter, "SMRT Working Through the Night to Recover Service Tomorrow Morning", informs commuters that they are expected to make alternative travel plans in the morning, as full services might not have resumed yet:

"SMRT has mobilised all engineering and technical staff to comprehensively check the entire network and train fleet. SMRT and LTA engineers are working round the clock to conduct tests, and sections of the network are being isolated to pin point the fault. While it is still early to conclude the cause of the fault, we are doing our utmost to recover the system with the view to resume full train services as soon as possible. We deeply apologise for the inconvenience caused to all our commuters," said Mr Desmond Kuek, President and Group CEO, SMRT Corporation.

As the NSEWL may commence limited services tomorrow morning, commuters are advised to make alternative travel plans. Free bus services will continue tomorrow morning, and fare gates will open until the resumption of full train services.
