The Singapore Civil Defence Force has been lauded by the public for working tirelessly through the night and day to bring North-South Line MRT services back on track.



New photos shared by SCDF showed their personnel at times in knee-high waters in the tunnel as they carried out their rescue operation of the MRT system.

The SCDF said they received a call for assistance at about 7pm on Saturday night after the tunnel between Braddell and Bishan became flooded with rainwater.

Praise
Even though much dissatisfaction has been targeted at SMRT the corporation and the management for yet another massive breakdown, ground staff have generally been praised for working tirelessly.

NSL resumes
Train services between Newton and Ang Mo Kio stations on the North-South Line (NSL) resumed at 1.50pm, SMRT said on Sunday, Oct. 8, about 20 hours after rain water flooded tunnels and crippled train operations.

“This follows an all-out, overnight effort to clear water in the tunnels between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations,” SMRT said, adding that teams from the SCDF, PUB, Land Tansport Authority together with SMRT worked jointly to pump out water from the tunnels.

On Saturday night, teams from SMRT and LTA also conducted network-wide checks on MRT tunnels.
