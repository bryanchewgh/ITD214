More train trips, better reliability in 2013: LTA

SINGAPORE — Train service reliability improved in the past year compared to 2012 since measures implemented by the Land Transport Authority and two public transport operators, the statutory board said today (Jan 9).

In the overall MRT network, the number of incidents causing delays of more than five minutes for every 100,000km travelled was 1.18, a 20 per cent decrease as compared to 1.49 in 2012 according to LTA figures.

On the North-South and East-West lines, SMRT has adopted new technology to step up on preventive maintenance since April. These includes the Automated Current Collector Devices to detect missing collector shoes on trains and the Wheel Impact Load Detection System to identify defects on the trains’ wheels. Collector shoes draw power from the Third Rail to run trains.

These measures will gradually be implemented on the Circle Line as well.

The LTA also said that commuters can also expect shorter waiting times during off peak periods, with operators increasing the number of weekly train trips since Jan 1.

On the NSEWL, over 400 more weekly train trips will be added progressively by September so that commuters will have to wait less than five minutes during off peak periods.

For the North East Line, more than 400 trains have been added, with off peak waiting times now ranging from between three or five minutes.

Rail disruptions spiked in 2011 with several high-profile incidents, which led to the Government setting up a Committee of Inquiry in December that year to look into causes of the breakdowns.
