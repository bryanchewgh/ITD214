The 7.5km Tuas West Extension will feature four stations, which include one close to the Second Link, as well as a new depot to take in more train fleet. It’s claimed the extension, scheduled to become operational in 2016, will help reduce travelling time by as much as 35 minutes.

By 2014, the North-South line will have 13 additional trains and by 2016, the East-West line will have 22 more trains. From 2015, 24 new trains will join the new Circle Line, while 18 trains will be added to the North-East line.
