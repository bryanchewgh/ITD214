Overloading has been and is still the main cause of the frequent MRT breakdowns that are frustrating commuters. Who gave the authority to overload the system? (“Root cause of latest MRT breakdown still not pinpointed”; July 10)

Even my maid knew not to overload our washing machine after its first breakdown. But at this juncture, maintenance engineers rank low in the hierarchy. The same goes for the engineering profession.

We must limit the overloading and supplement MRT travel with alternative solutions. Companies should be encouraged to decentralise. Rents would be lower too.
