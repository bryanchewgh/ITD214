The transport minister, Khaw Boon Wan announced the $344 million renewal project for the 19-year-old LRT system in March earlier this year, stating that the system is reaching the end of its useful life.

The renewal project, which has started this year, has covered the upgrade of the line’s existing signalling system and said to introduce more redundancy to the system to ensure trains are kept running.

The power rail along the entire 7.8km-long BPLRT will also be replaced and more robust power rail brackets will be installed.

The new signalling system and new trains will be fully rolled out by 2022, while other works such as the replacement of the power rail, and decommissioning of the old signalling system’s track circuits should be completed by 2024.
