An SMRT train was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm today afternoon (May 11), causing train service from Yishun to Yio Chu Kang stations on the North-South Line to be disrupted for over 40 minutes.

SMRT said in its initial tweets, starting at about 4pm, that the train service was disrupted due to "train fault".


In an updated report today evening, The Straits Times reported that Mr Patrick Nathan, SMRT's vice-president of corporate information and communications, said: "At 3.46pm today, it was suspected that lightning struck a location between Yio Chu Kang and Khatib Station along the North-South Line."

The report also said that the driver, who "smelled something burning", reported the incident.

The affected train had to be pushed out by another train, and passengers alighted at Yio Chu Kang station.

The train has been withdrawn from service.

Service on the stretch resumed at about 4.35pm, according to SMRT.
