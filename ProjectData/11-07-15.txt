Ageing MRT system requires more vigilance

I think of the economic and other costs of the latest MRT breakdown. Naturally, our Prime Minister is concerned about the integrity of our network (“Root cause of rail breakdown not found; PM ‘very concerned’”, July 9).

As a layperson, I realise the difficulty of running such a system, but having said that, we have been doing this for so many years. Surely, solid lessons have been learnt from the previous Committee of Inquiry.

My question is: Have we become complacent about the standard operating procedures, especially of our maintenance programmes?

Since ours is an ageing system, we should be more vigilant and perhaps even paranoid about improving our maintenance programmes, so as to eliminate random or freak breakdowns.

I wonder how our system compares with Tokyo’s, for example. Its system is just as heavily used and older than ours. Yet, I have observed from my visits there that its operations are amazingly efficient and reliable.
