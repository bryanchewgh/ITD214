Singapore starts weekend with late night breakdown along East-West Line

11 November 2017

After the many breakdowns during the morning and evening rush hours this week, SMRT is faced with a service disruption along its East West Line (EWL) that will continue past midnight.

Singapore Mass Rapid Transport (SMRT) first informed of a delay at 9:53pm Friday (10 Nov) evening that due to a train fault, commuters are to add 30 minutes of travel time from Bugis to Queenstown station and noted that the fault is not linked to the new signalling project.


Followed by its usual tweet that free regular bus services is available between Bugis and Queenstown in both directions:


Though SMRT announced the delay at 9pm, commuters have tweeted about the slow down and delay since around 7pm on Friday.

NSL and EWL super crowdedâ€¦. decided to take DTL instead.

@SMRT_Singapore no announcement on chaos at tanah merah now? Been waiting 40 min for train to airport and had to board/disembark two trains, take an incorrect train to simei & backtrack, was deposited at the WRONG platform and had to go down and come back up to the right platform

Fuck you seriously SMRT. You should have announced this way earlier. I donâ€™t get why poor commuters like us have to pay for your screw ups with our time and money. No form of compensation is ever mentioned and we are just expected to accept your shit

Where is your bridging bus service? I was stuck at PayaLebar MRT at 0015hrs. Your staff told me to walk all the way out to the main road and find a regular bus to take. I ended up taking a bus 28 (last bus), paid for the ride, dropped at Tampines and walked to Simei! So angry.

And again at 12:13am, SMRT updated that there was no train service from Bugis to Tanah Merah towards Pasir Ris:
