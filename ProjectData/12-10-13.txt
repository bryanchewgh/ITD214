SINGAPORE — The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will require SMRT to submit a detailed incident report to assess whether its maintenance processes for its third-rail system are adequate, after a “defective third rail” led to a 30-minute service disruption between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris MRT stations yesterday morning.

According to a post on SMRT’s Facebook page, the affected third rail was on the stretch between Simei and Tanah Merah stations.

The third rail supplies power to trains and problems with the third-rail system led to the December 2011 service breakdowns.

An LTA spokesperson said the authority “takes the safety and reliability of our MRT system seriously” and would be investigating the incident. SMRT’s incident report will also allow the LTA to “better understand the likely factors that led to the disruption”.

The LTA noted that SMRT took immediate action upon detecting the defective third rail, such as imposing speed restrictions on trains passing the stretch and deploying staff to repair the affected third rail as soon as the weather allowed.

SMRT also allowed for free boarding of public buses and operated shuttle trains between Pasir Ris and Tampines to reduce the inconvenience caused during the disruption.

SMRT’s track-maintenance team carries out regular inspection and maintenance of tracks and tunnels.

The LTA also conducts audits and inspections on the rail operators to ensure the rails are properly maintained, it added.

The disruption is the second incident in two days on the East-West Line. On Thursday evening, service between Boon Lay and Joo Koon stations was stalled for about an hour due to a track-circuit failure.
