SINGAPORE — The authorities, SMRT and SBS Transit will be conducting a joint exercise this month to test the contingency plans that have been enhanced since the July 7 train breakdown, the worst-ever to hit Singapore.

In a post on the Ministry of Transport blog, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said he had asked the LTA to conduct the exercise, which he will observe.

Noting that even the “best in class” — Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway — experiences on average one major disruption monthly, Mr Khaw said comprehensive contingency plans for breakdowns are necessary. “More importantly, there must be actual and regular walk-throughs and “live rehearsals”. This will ensure smoother execution of such plans when disruptions happen,” said Mr Khaw in his post, his seventh since his appointment was announced last month.

Such table top and ground deployment exercises, which are already being done, should also be conducted with “top management present”. “Otherwise, the staff may carry them out half-heartedly, just to put a “tick” in the check-boxes. Through these exercises, we can also pick up learning points to further improve our plans,” said Mr Khaw.

He did not reveal details of when and where the latest exercise would be conducted. Three such exercises were carried out previously, the first involving SMRT at Buona Vista MRT station in November 2012. The second one involved SBS Transit at Kovan MRT station in August 2013, and the third involved both operators at Bayfront MRT station in May this year. Train services were not affected by the exercises.
