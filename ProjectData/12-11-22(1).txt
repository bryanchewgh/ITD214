SINGAPORE - Water from a nearby construction site caused flooding at the entrance of Tanah Merah MRT station during the downpour on Saturday afternoon, rail operator SMRT said.

Videos circulating on social media showed commuters wading through ankle-high water at the entrance of the station in New Upper Changi Road.

“On Nov 12 at around 3pm, water from a construction site next to Tanah Merah MRT station caused flooding at the entrance of the station,” said SMRT Trains president Lam Sheau Kai.

“Our staff worked with cleaners and the construction site workers to clear the water immediately,” Mr Lam said in an e-mail to The Straits Times.

“For the safety of commuters, our staff were also mobilised to guide them away from the affected area,” he said, noting the water was cleared by around 5pm.

SMRT is working with the construction site supervisors to prevent the situation from recurring, he added.

Train service was not affected.
