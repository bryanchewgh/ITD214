Train service at several stations on the North-East Line was suspended for at least 20 minutes during the Tuesday (Oct 13th) morning rush hour due to a power fault, reported The Straits Times.

Scores of commuters were left stranded, as reports of blackouts at four stations - Hougang, Kovan, Serangoon and Woodleigh - streamed in on social media.

Rail operator SBS Transit first tweeted an announcement at 7:58am, warning commuters to expect an additional 15 minutes of travelling time. Another tweet minutes later said train service between Farrer Park and Hougang stations had stopped. It said that free bus services were available at designated bus stops.

As of 8:28am, SBS Transit said full train service had resumed, although it warned that trains were still crowded and delays could be expected.
