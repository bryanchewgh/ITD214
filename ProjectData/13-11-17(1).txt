Putting a price to the high expectations of the MRT system

Is it even surprising anymore to hear about yet another breakdown happening along our rail lines?

Commuters who use public transportation such as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transport (LRT) provided by SMRT are very concerned about the service quality of the lines, saying it is not up to standards.

Singapore’s public transport fares are among one of the cheapest in the world, even if the quality of transport service is debatable.

There are no other substitutes for commuters here, unlike in countries such as Taiwan and Japan, where there are numerous trains or rail operators, so companies have the incentive to improve the quality and experience for passengers.

In SMRT’s case, the lack of close competitors results in a situation where it may be contented with providing the minimum service level and there is no push to strive hard to improve quality or to be the best.

Commuters also need to do adjust their expectations. If they want the quality of service to improve, are they willing to pay higher fares? It is unrealistic to expect a high quality of service without cost, or fares increasing, given that resources such as manpower are scarce.

Commuters can indicate a willingness to pay for better service through their “dollar votes”. It is only fair that such services are given to those who value them the most.

Unlike a cup of coffee, which can be replaced by drinks as substitutes, public transportation has an inelastic demand. There is a price to everything.
