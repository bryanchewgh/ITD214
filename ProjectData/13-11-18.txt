Train breakdown on Sunday afternoon along the Circle Line

13 November 2018

A train disruption occurred on Sunday (11 Nov) afternoon along the Circle Line (CCL). This time, while there were not many passengers because it was not a work day, SMRT was quick to inform about the incident,

SMRT informed in a tweet that there was no train service between Marina Bay/Dhoby Ghaut to Paya Lebar due to signal fault at 3:30pm:


As it was not a working day at a non peak hour, there were only a couple post on Twitter from commuters on the delay:

Twenty minutes later, at 3:50pm, SMRT again tweeted that the fault has been rectified, train service was progressively returning to normal. But travel time between Marina Bay/Dhoby Ghaut to Paya Lebar still needed additional 15 minutes:

[CCL] UPDATE: The fault has been rectified. Train service is progressively returning to normal. Do continue to add 15 mins train travel time between #DhobyGhaut, #Marinabay to #Payalebar. Free buses are still available at the affected stations.

And at 4:15pm SMRT informed that the CCL train service has resumed:

[CCL] CLEARED: Train services have resumed. Free regular & bridging bus services have ended.

However, it looked like the effect of the delay still went on at 4:41pm, as a tweet showed a grumble about the breakdown. Akmal complained that despite all the early closure for maintenance the train still experienced breakdowns.

On 24 Oct SMRT announced that every Friday and Saturday in November, 6 East-West Line stations from Tuas Link to Pioneer will close earlier at around 11pm:


And last Wednesday evening, the Bukit Panjang LRT (BPLRT) experienced delays due to a power failure at Bukit Panjang Station.
