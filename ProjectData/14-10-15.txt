SINGAPORE — Commuters on the North East Line were left stranded during the morning rush hour yesterday (Oct 13) after a power failure stalled trains for more than half an hour.

The power trip happened in the midst of morning rush hour at about 7.41am. Train services between Hougang and Farrer Park stations were stalled, and five stations — Buangkok, Hougang, Kovan, Serangoon and Woodleigh — experienced power blackouts, said SBS Transit, which runs the North East Line.

Emergency lights were activated in all five stations. Power supply to the affected stations was progressively restored from 8.02am while trains resumed gradual service from 8.11am. Full service resumed at about 8.20am. However, stations were still crowded at 9am, and the transport operator had cautioned that delays could be expected.

“During this period, free bus rides as well as shuttle buses were available between the affected stations,” said Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit’s senior vice-president for corporate communications. “We apologise to all passengers for the distress and inconvenience caused. We are investigating the cause of the fault.”

The transport operator did not respond to queries on how many commuters were affected and whether any passengers had to be detrained. It also did not elaborate when asked what caused the power trip. The Land Transport Authority is looking into the incident.

Last month, a signalling fault between Sengkang and Punggol stations caused two train delays on the North East Line in the morning.

The line also saw power faults last year, with one incident in August causing services to break down between Punggol and Sengkang MRT stations for nine hours, affecting 18,000 commuters.

In another incident in March last year, train services between Hougang and Dhoby Ghaut stations were disrupted for more than 30 minutes, affecting about 5,900 passengers.
