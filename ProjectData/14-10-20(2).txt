A power fault affected thousands of commuters on three MRT lines on Oct. 14 during evening peak hour.


Commuters on board affected trains had to take alternative transport, such as the free bridging buses provided by SMRT.

That, however, led to crowding at bus stops.

The situation at the bus stop outside Queenstown MRT at around 10:30pm showed hordes of people queuing up:

As of 10:40pm, SMRT updated that all affected MRT lines have resumed.


Ong Ye Kung gives updates on situation
Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung provided an update at around 10pm that the remaining passengers on the last North-South line train have disembarked at Bukit Batok station.

Crowds at bus stops are slowing thinning out.

He added that the One Transport team is doing their best to assist affected passengers.


Ong later elaborated that around 115 bridging buses and 400 SMRT staff were deployed to affected MRT stations and bus stops.
He apologised for the "rough and stressful" evening and said that the engineering team will be working through the night to fix the problem.


The Land and Transport Authority said preliminary investigations showed that a power trip could be the cause of the disruption.
