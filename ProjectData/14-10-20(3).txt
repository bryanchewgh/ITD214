After more than three hours of disruptions, the train services on North-South Line, East-West Line and Circle Line have resumed operations.

A power trip was suspected to have caused the train service disruption at over 30 train stations, affecting thousands of commuters on Oct. 14 evening.


In response to the breakdown, Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung wrote two Facebook posts to address what happened.

Ong first provided an update of the situation at around 10pm and said that transport workers were doing their best to help affected commuters.
