Disperse crowds quickly during train disruptions

It is not possible to maintain a 100 per cent breakdown-free MRT system, but more can be done in contingency measures when breakdowns do occur (“The day the trains stood still”; Talking Point).

It is uncomfortable for commuters to be stuck in crowded trains without air conditioning. The authorities should look into imposing a cut-off time: Commuters should not be trapped for a long time while the operator ponders its next action.

Crowds swell fast when there is a breakdown, and should be dispersed quickly. At bus stops near affected stations, free rides on public bus services — not limited to the train operator’s buses — should be provided in the initial hours of the breakdown.

This is to encourage the crowds to take any available public transport from the affected area. The costs can be charged to the train operator as part of the breakdown fine.

Also, announcements about affected lines should be made in all MRT stations, instead of the current practice of, say, SMRT providing the status of train services only on its own lines.
