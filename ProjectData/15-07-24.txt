MRT reliability up in first quarter; more frequent delays on LRT lines

SINGAPORE - MRT trains went longer without delays in the first quarter of 2024 as the overall reliability of the rail network improved, latest figures from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) show.

That said, the data also showed that the Circle Line (CCL) and the two LRT lines fared worse than before.

On average, MRT trains clocked 2.32 million train-km without service delays that lasted more than five minutes in the 12 months ending in March. This is higher than the 2.08 million train-km between delays in 2023.

The reliability figures are published by the LTA on a quarterly basis using a 12-month moving average of mean kilometres between failures (MKBF) – an engineering measure of rail reliability.

The latest report published on July 11 showed that the CCL, operated by SMRT, was the least reliable among five MRT lines.

CCL trains went an average of 1.03 million train-km between delays, or 181,000 train-km below 2023’s performance and a further slide down from 2022’s 1.84 million train-km.

The Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) was not included in the report as the line is not fully open. LTA has said current operation figures will not accurately represent its reliability when compared with existing lines. The fifth and final stage of the TEL is expected to be ready in 2026.
