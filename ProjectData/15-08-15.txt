Breakdown of trains inevitable due to wear, tear

I thank Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew for contributing to Singapore’s transport. He has handled situations with ease and kept promises. I am shocked that he is retiring from the Cabinet (“Transport Minister Lui to leave politics”; Aug 12).

After the major MRT breakdown last month, some of us were angry with the service reliability of trains. Nobody can be blamed for the situation; we must accept that the trains broke down.

It has been a long time since the red and green lines were opened. All old facilities fail over time. Cars, too, break down, or their components fail after years of usage. It is eventually the same for train systems.

Some people would argue that SMRT should have better train maintenance. However, nothing can be fixed permanently. Instead of complaining, one should look at the measures SMRT is taking, such as sleeper replacement works, to reduce the breakdowns.

New lines are also being built. Train operating times have even been extended for Singaporeans’ travelling convenience, reducing the time for maintaining and replacing the tracks. This is why we should start thinking before we complain about anything.
