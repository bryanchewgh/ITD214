Train breakdown along the EWL on Tuesday evening, purportedly due to power fault

15 August 2018

The train service was disrupted along the East West Line (EWL) for more than an hour on Tuesday evening. Commuters were confused due to different causes mentioned in different announcements by SMRT; some said the delay was due to power failure but others said it was caused by door fault. This is coupled with the lack of official information from SMRT at the beginning of the service disruption.

Passengers‚Äô post on Twitter started around 6:30pm, informing the train delay and raising complaints:
