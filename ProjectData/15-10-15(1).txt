A train fault in Clementi held up thousands of commuters heading for work in town Thursday (Oct 15th) morning on the East-West MRT line, reported The Straits Times.

Operator SMRT tweeted that trains were moving slower than usual towards the east, and that travel time between Clementi and Queenstown would take 15 minutes more or so. Later, it revised the delay to 20 minutes. Its tweet was posted around 10:00am.

But passengers already knew something was not right earlier on.

Mr. Cole Cheong was among those affected, and said his commute to work in the city was "15 to 20 minutes longer" than usual. "The train was moving very slowly, and stopped a few times between Chinese Garden and Buona Vista," he said, adding that it resumed normal speed only after Buona Vista.

At 10:17am, SMRT tweeted to say the faulty train has been cleared, and services were now operating normally between Clementi and Queenstown.
