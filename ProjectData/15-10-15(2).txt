Train breakdown contingency plans welcomed by commuters


15 Oct 2015


Singaporeans welcome the new contingency measures for train breakdowns, namely the activation of special bus services and private bus operators.

Given the choice, commuters would rather the trains didn't break down. However, they are glad that train operators are at least drawing up new measures to help passengers during large-scale breakdowns, which they noted were becoming more commonplace.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will activate special bus services, laid on by public as well as private bus operators, in the event of multiple line-wide service disruptions. These extra buses will boost current bus-bridging services offered by SMRT and SBS Transit to ferry stranded passengers to key interchange stations and major town centres, The Straits Times reported.

Yesterday, the LTA, together with SMRT and SBS Transit, conducted a joint exercise to put their readiness plans to the test. Exercise Greyhound simulated multiple power trips on the East-West Line during the morning peak hours, which resulted in the suspension of train operations along the entire line. The MRT stations involved in the drill were Buona Vista, Outram Park and Tiong Bahru, on the East-West Line. It was carried out while regular train services operated as normal, and commuters were not affected.
