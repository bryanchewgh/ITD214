Free bus rides during major rail disruptions


15 Oct 2015


Aside from plans for all bus rides to be free during major rail disruptions, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is also looking to make fare refunds easier.

All bus rides will be free in the event of a network-wide rail disruption like the one on the 7th of July. These free rides will include those on private buses, which will be roped in to assist in such large-scale breakdowns, The Straits Times reported.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is working on ways to make fare refunds in the aftermath of such disruptions more painless. Currently, commuters queue up at stations for refunds, adding to the crowd and confusion of a breakdown.

At the same time, the LTA is also creating a mobile phone app to channel information to commuters as quickly and as clearly as possible. The app, which could be ready by year end, will include information such as which lines are affected, alternative routes available and which bus stops to go to.

The LTA revealed these during a joint exercise with SMRT and SBS Transit on Wednesday, the 14th of October to test an enhanced incident management plan.
