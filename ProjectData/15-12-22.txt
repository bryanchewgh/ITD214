Some passengers were unhappy after train services were disrupted on the East-West Line on Wednesday morning (Dec 14).

Stomper Tom alerted Stomp to the incident and shared photos and videos of commuters leaving Pioneer MRT Station to queue for free bridging bus services to continue their journeys.

He also shared a video taken at Lakeside MRT Station of commuters encountering issues.



"Some customers could not tap in to Lakeside MRT Station," he said.

"The lift at the MRT station was also faulty so everyone had to climb the staircase, even the elderly."

In a Facebook post, SMRT said the disruption was due to a power failure caused by a signalling fault between Joo Koon and Boon Lay.


The statement said: "At about 11.20am on 14 Dec, a power failure caused the signalling fault between Joo Koon and Boon Lay stations on the East West Line.

"Our engineers were activated immediately to rectify the fault on site.

"In-train and station announcements were made to inform commuters.

"Free regular and bridging bus services were activated between Gul Circle and Lakeside stations.

"Train services progressively resumed at 12pm.

"We apologise to commuters who were affected."
