A train on the Sengkang LRT line broke down yesterday (Feb 16), the first day of the Chinese New Year.

Passengers had to get down and walk on the tracks.

A Stomper shared a photo with Stomp of passengers approaching an LRT station by foot.

"People had to take their oranges and walk on the LRT track," he said.

SBS Transit told The Straits Times that a light rail vehicle (LRV) on the Sengkang West loop stalled at 11.09am as it was approaching the Sengkang Town Centre station due to a power fault.

"At the time of the incident, a loud noise was heard due to a dislodged power collector shoe on the LRV. This caused the LRV to stall immediately as a safety feature."

Fifteen commuters were affected. No one was injured.

Another LRV pushed the defective one out of the line so that services could resume on the Sengkang West inner loop.

Service resumed at about 1pm.

Services on the Sengkang West outer loop, which moves in the opposite direction and serves the same stations, were not affected by the disruption, SBS Transit said.

Ms Tammy Tan, SBS Transit's senior vice-president for corporate communications, said: "We apologise to affected commuters for the inconvenience caused. Meanwhile we are investigating the cause of the fault."
