Transport delays during rush hour: Companies, schools can do their part

With the recent MRT breakdowns, Singaporeans are now getting more aggravated with SMRT. However, the transport company is not entirely to blame.

The problem is that there are not many transport options here during peak hours that cater to huge crowds.

These peak hours are when both students and adults rush to and from school and work, resulting in a suge of commuters on buses, trains or cars.

Singapore-based companies should work towards accommodating this situation by changing the daily work structure to one that does not require fixed working hours, but rather measurable tasks.

The Ministry of Education already put in place emergency plans for those taking national examinations. Schools should have more afternoon sessions to alleviate this problem.

I only hope fewer people would be dismayed when delays happen.
