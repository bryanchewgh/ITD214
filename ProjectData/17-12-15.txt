We refer to Mr Jason Ho’s letter “MRT evacuation drills may improve response to train breakdowns” (Dec 5) and agree that drills can improve our preparedness for train breakdowns.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) regularly conducts large-scale ground deployment exercises at MRT stations, as well as tabletop exercises to test the readiness of our public transport operators and the LTA in various scenarios.

These exercises enhance our response procedures and ensure that the operators and other stakeholders maintain a high level of operational readiness to manage train incidents.

Exercise Greyhound was the latest exercise, conducted on Oct 14, when the LTA and public transport operators SMRT and SBS Transit jointly tested the enhanced incident management plans for major disruptions.

Existing measures, such as shuttle bus services and free boarding of regular bus services along the affected rail corridor, were activated. SMRT and SBS Transit staff were deployed to attend to affected commuters.

Additional measures, including special shuttle services that ply between major towns and key interchange stations, as well as beacon lights at bus stops to indicate the availability of free boarding of regular buses, were also tested.

Besides these exercises, the LTA conducts regular audits at every train station to ensure that all transport staff members are familiar with the Rail and Bus Incident Management Plans.

These audits cover key incident management areas such as customer service, information dissemination and bus bridging. The LTA will continue to work with the public transport operators to improve our emergency preparedness and incident management.

We thank Mr Ho for the opportunity to clarify.
