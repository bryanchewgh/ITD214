This time SMRT was quick to respond, at 9:57pm it posted a tweet that due to a track fault, train travel time between Tampines and Pasir Ris will be delayed for 20mins:


At 9:58pm Alan Yap responded to SMRT on TATA SMRT Facebook , giving useful details for the free bus services:

Alan Yap wrote: ‚ÄúLATEST UPDATE EWL: DUE TO TRACK FAULT TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN TAMPINES AND PASIR RIS WILL BE DELAYED BY 20 MINUTES FREE REGULAR BUS SERVICES IS AVAILABLE BETWEEN TAMPINES AND PASIR RIS STATIONS.‚Äù ‚Äú

This means passengers may board ANY SBS/SMRT/Go-Ahead public bus service for free (no need to tap card or pay cash fare) at key bus stops outside these affected stations. Look out for the flashing orange blinker light at the affected bus stops. Do not be confused with the point to point MRT bridging shuttle service, which is not activated at this present moment.‚Äù

Others also posted about the delay on TATA SMRT Facebook platform:

John Robert Lee shared a post from MRT Singapore Service Information at 10:02pm; he wrote: ‚ÄúTrack failure between Tampines and Pasir Ris, causing service delay of 20 mins. Free bus services available between Tampines & Pasir Ris.‚Äù

Wayne Chew wrote at 10:03pm: ‚ÄúAdd 20 mins between Pasir Ris and Tampines due to track fault.‚Äù

At 10:38pm Syed M Daniel shared a photo from MRT Singapore Service Information:



And at 11:39 John Robert Lee shared a video from MRT Singapore Service Information; he wrote: ‚ÄúThis is the current situation at Pasir Ris. Entering the station via the opposite direction from Tampines at a very slow speed. I am speculating this incident may last until tonight.‚Äù

Since the train can‚Äôt go from Tampines to Pasir Ris, the rest of the trains behind will be held up as well. I got fed up of waiting in the train at Tanah Merah station and went to take bus instead. üñïüèª SMRT

But at 10:27pm SMRT asked for longer travel time of 10 minutes between Tampines and Pasir Ris:

At 10:49pm SMRT repeated its tweet:

[EWL] UPDATE: Due to an earlier track fault, please expect longer travelling time of 10 mins btwn #Tampines and #PasirRis.

A passenger questioned the promised free buses because the bus drivers at Tampines Interchange were unaware of it. They said there‚Äôs no announcement at all. It was nearly impossible to find ‚Äòfree shuttle buses‚Äô:
