7 hours of train service disruption; Traffic chaos along East West Line on Wednesday morning


19 September 2018


A massive train disruption took place this morning along the East West Line (EWL) due to a track point fault at Clementi, which started at about 7am and ended around 1.50pm in the afternoon. The disruption and confusion of free shuttle buses left passengers confused and angry, who then posted a barrage of posts and tweets on the social media platforms to voice their displease and to highlight the chaos ensued from the breakdown.

On TATA SMRT Facebook platform posts from commuters stuck at Queens Town and Jurong East have started since about 7am:

Renfred Wang wrote at 7:07am: “SMRT no announcement on EWL delay. Stuck at Queens Town towards Tuas for 10 mins now.”

CoLieen Lim posted a photo at 7:14am: “Situation at Jurong East station. 7:15am.”



WB LM wrote at 7:15am: “[EWL]: Due to a track point fault at Clementi, train service between Jurong East and Clementi will be delayed for 30mins. Free regular bus service is available between JurongEast and Queenstown.”

John Robert Lee wrote that the announcement warns train service between JE and Clementi would be delayed for 30 minutes:

John Robert Lee shared a post from MRT Singapore Service Information at 7:22am; he wrote: “Yesterday, you have PSD Failure at JE because of pax try to force open the faulty PSD. Today, you have track point failure between JE and Clementi. Don’t know what’s going on but… Service between JE and Clementi will be Delayed for 30 mins and free bus services operations are available between Boon Lay And Queenstown.

Swee Thian Sim wrote at 7:43am: “No train service on East West line.”

Nur Azlinawaty said the additional travel time needed was not 30 minutes but 45 minutes for the passengers from both the Western and Eastern regions:

Nur Azlinawaty Abdul Rahman wrote at 8:09am: “Passengers on E-W Line should add 45 mins to their travel, not the supposed 30 mins. This applies not just for those in the West. The Easterners too.”

While SMRT kept tweeting announcement to update the passengers but the problems seemed to have gone from bad to worse, from 30 minutes of additional travel time at 8:15am to 40 minutes:




Passengers were confused and complained about the free bus services; some said that the ‘free’ bus service was a lie:

Free buses are a lie. We are still required to tap our cards and fare is still deducted. What sorcery is this?

There were also confusions caused by the announcements and notifications given by the SMRT about the locations and delay times:

I think you need to be clearer than that. The train services on the east side is effectively down due to the congestion anyway. I've been stuck in the train in the east for 30 mins due to the track fault.

And there were also many tweets from commuters asking whether they could ask for refund:

Tapped in to clementi mrt. Kena chased out because of train fault. Tapped out and $0.77 deducted. Hi @SMRT_Singapore, any chance of refund?

— விக்னேஷ்🧊🔥 (@JoeMuniyandi) September 18, 2018
