Train delay along NSL on Tuesday morning – EWL affected


20 February 2019

After three weeks went by without train disruptions since 29 Jan, this morning (19 Feb) commuters along the North South Line (NSL) have to experience delays due to train fault at Sembawang Station. Apparently  this also affected the trains along East West Line (EWL) toward the West.

No official information was given by SMRT on its social media platform, some passengers informed the announcement were given on the trains and stations.

Several commuters posted their information on the train breakdown on Twitter, some complained and asked for SMRT’s official announcement:

On TATA SMRT Facebook platform, commuters also informed about the breakdown and additional traveling time:

Li MeiHui Eunice wrote at 8:11am: “Northbound train towards Braddell station on NSL just announced train fault ahead, estimated delay of 5 mins.”

Matthias Goh wrote at 8:11am: “Just heard from PA at AMK MRT Stn Due to a earlier train fault at SBW stn, this train service will be slighty delayed towards Jurong East.”

Li MeiHui Eunice wrote at 8:19am: “Now the additional travelling time is up to 10 mins from Khatib to Woodlands.”

Alen Charles Yap, the Admin of TATA SMRT posted more information on the train delay:

Alan Charles Yap wrote at 8:18am: “UPDATE @ 08:26 – we are getting reports from members that delays to travel time towards JUR is now increased to 10 mins and affecting train services before Sembawang Station.

Train cars after Sembawang are running smoothly but headway will be regulated to factor the delay, so do expect longer dwell time at some stations and go-stop-go (intermittent braking) movement during your journey.

As of now, no official announcement from operator SMRT.”

At 8:40am Epsye Lim informed that Westbound trains along the EWL were slow:

The faults seemed to have been taken care of after 9am, no other posts sent by passengers.
