North-South Line passes 100-day milestone without disruption: Khaw Boon Wan

Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced on his blog that it has been 100 days since the North-South Line last experienced a major incident.

It has been 100 days since the North-South Line (NSL) last experienced a major incident, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced on his blog, reported The Straits Times. 

The NSL achieved the feat on Monday, joining the Downtown Line  - which passed 178 days without disruption - in clearing the 100-day milestone. "For us in the rail industry, clearing 100 disruption-free days is no mean feat: it requires everyone to do everything right. Any misstep can cause a disruption," Mr. Khaw wrote in his post, titled 'On track to better rail reliability'.

Mr. Khaw said that the NSL's feat is especially inspiring as it is the oldest of Singapore's five MRT lines. "Its success gives us confidence that with hard work and strong determination, we will improve our rail reliability," he added.

Likening the challenge of continued success to a game of snakes and ladders, Mr. Khaw warned that any lapse and it is back to square one. The task of stabilising the existing rail system and making it more reliable is made harder by the expanding rail capacity, as new trains are added and run more frequently.
