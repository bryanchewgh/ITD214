Commuters stranded for one hour on NEL train

20 Jun 2013


Around 50,000 passengers were affected by the NEL train which broke down yesterday evening, causing a two-hour disruption.

Around 250 commuters had to walk through the tunnel to be evacuated when their train broke down yesterday. The incident took place during the evening rush hour, where a North-East Line (NEL) train stalled before reaching Hougang station.

Passengers were left stranded on the train for an hour before they detrained and were asked to walk to the next station. The incident also caused a two-hour service disruption between Woodleigh and Punggol, affecting about 50,000 passengers.

Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew reacted strongly to the incident, and wrote in a Facebook post saying he is "dismayed at how the incident was managed".

An SBS Transit spokesman said about 90 staffs were deployed to help commuters at the seven affected stations.

The Straits Times also reported that officers from the Police Special Operations Command were on site to help control the human flow, as crowds formed at Woodleigh station's shuttle bus pickup point. Although 85 buses were deployed to shuttle between the stations, many were delayed en route due to traffic jams.

The last major disruption on the NEL happened in January, lasting for more than six hours and affected about 60,000 people.
