LTA to investigate NEL train disruption

21 Jun 2013


Train operator SBS Transit will come under probe for cause of disruption and incident management of the two-hour service disruption on Wednesday.

The two-hour NEL train disruption is currently under investigation by the Land Transport Authority (LTA). The incident took place on Wednesday, affecting close to 50,000 commuters during the evening rush hour.

The Straits Times reported that the investigation will look into SBS Transit's management of the incident, such as 'rescue and detrainment of commuters', as well as the cause of the train fault.

The train stalled when approaching Hougang station. As per recovery procedure, a second train was deployed to push it to the nearest station, but the stalled train did not budge. Services between Woodleigh and Punggol was affected for two hours as a result.

A spokesman said SBS Transit could not pin-point the cause of the train fault yet, but investigations are ongoing.

Speaking to the local paper, Banking Officer Vivien Chionh, who was at Woodleigh, described the situation as 'chaotic'. She said there was not enough staff, nor was any signboard erected to guide commuters to the shuttle bus pickup point. The buses which arrived were also full.
