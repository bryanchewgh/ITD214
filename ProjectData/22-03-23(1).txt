March 22, 2023

The number of disruptions in Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) services, lasting more 30 minutes, more than doubled during 2022 as compared to 2021. However, the total number of delays fell during the year with the mean km before failure (MKBF) recorded at 2.09 million train-km in 2022, compared to 1.994 million train-km in 2021.

The line with the highest reliability was Downtown Line with the worst-performing line being the North-South Line (NSL) recording more than 1.6 million train-km before a failure. Compared to the seven major service disruptions on MRT lines in Singapore, there were only two recorded cases of major service breakdown on Singaporeâ€™s LRT lines.

Commuter satisfaction during 2022 fell by 0.5 percentage point primarily due to bus service reliability.
