SINGAPORE: A signalling fault between Promenade and Nicoll Highway MRT stations on the Circle Line caused delays on Friday (Mar 22) morning.

Train operator SMRT first flagged the issue on Facebook at about 9.30am, advising commuters to factor in an additional 30 minutes of travel time between the Paya Lebar and Dhoby Ghaut or Marina Bay stations. 



It later revised the additional travel time to 20 minutes in an update at 10.10am. 

Free regular bus services were available during this period. 

In a subsequent post, SMRT said that the signalling fault occurred at about 9.20am, with its engineers on-site to rectify the fault.

Regular train services "resumed progressively" from about 10.20am with service fully resuming at 10.30am. 

"We are sorry for affecting your morning commute," said SMRT.
