Commuters on the Downtown Line faced significant disruptions this morning as train services between Fort Canning and Mattar Stations were temporarily suspended due to an unspecified issue.

SBS Transit, the operator of the Downtown Line, alerted the public to the closure early today and implemented several alternative transportation measures to mitigate the inconvenience.


The service interruption was first announced at 6:17 AM via social media by SBS Transit. Commuters needing access to key stations such as Macpherson and Bugis were advised to use the East-West Line (Green). For instance, to reach Macpherson, passengers were directed to travel to EW8 Paya Lebar on the East-West Line and then transfer to the Circle Line (Yellow) to CC10 MacPherson. Similarly, to get to Bugis, commuters could use the East-West Line directly to EW12 or switch lines at Paya Lebar.

To accommodate passengers affected by the disruption, SBS Transit arranged free regular and bridging bus services between Chinatown and Bedok North Stations. A shuttle train service also operated between MacPherson and Bedok North to help ease the commute for those traveling along the affected route.

Progress towards resuming normal service was made by 7:35 AM, as SBS Transit reported that full service on the Downtown Line had started to resume progressively since 7:26 AM.


However, they warned that stations might still experience crowding and that delays could be expected. Service was fully restored by 8:01 AM, but the operator continued to offer free bus services and advised passengers to expect some ongoing delays.

SBS Transit extended their apologies for the inconvenience caused by the disruption. Commuters were encouraged to check for real-time updates and consider alternative routes as the situation stabilized.
