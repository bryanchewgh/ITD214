If poor leadership is an issue, consider a change of management

Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has blamed the team in charge of maintaining the anti-flooding system at Bishan MRT Station for the Oct 7 incident that affected the North-South Line.

Similarly, SMRT’s chairman Seah Moon Ming and group chief executive Desmond Kuek acted against the maintenance team by removing the team leader and cutting their bonuses.

But in light of repeated train disruptions, it is fair to ask: What actions will be taken against the management team itself?

Finger-pointing is never a good idea. Nor is silence. There was no word from Mr Kuek when the breakdowns were happening, and it took several days before he appeared before Singaporeans to explain what had happened.

One wonders if the “deep-seated cultural issues” Mr Kuek brought up have anything to do with poor leadership? If so, an overhaul is needed for change to happen. Perhaps the company should consider getting leaders with experience to run a rail network.
