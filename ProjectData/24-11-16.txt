S’pore team did good job of solving Circle Line woes

I refer to the report “Faulty hardware on single train identified as cause of CCL issues” (Nov 12). I congratulate the team on solving a challenging technical glitch through teamwork, resolve and an assiduous attitude.

I cannot imagine the number of hours and sleepless nights they spent on this issue. And it is heart-warming that it was our experts, not overseas consultants, who resolved it.

This shows that our engineers have gained enough knowledge and exposure over the years and are competent enough to rise to any occasion. It is good to know that we have signalling expertise in Singapore.

However, if the MRT team did not dig up all the data, check mobile signals, et cetera, I doubt that the defence experts could have solved the mystery within a weekend.

As Thomas Edison once said: “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work”.

Maybe the MRT team did all it could but needed someone from outside to look at the problem again.

One of my friends works nine to five as an accountant in SMRT. She is on standby after office hours, however, to help out when train service is down. This is the type of commitment from SMRT to commuters.

I understand the frustration at train breakdowns, especially if one is late for work, school or appointments. I have experienced this too.

But in this case, it was a job well done. I believe the rail system will get better with this same level of dedication to their work. Let us set an audacious goal of achieving zero downtime in future.
