Train delay along EWL on Friday Evening purportedly due to train fault at Pasir Ris, no official announcement made by SMRT

25 August 2018

The train service along the East West Line (EWL) was reported to have been disrupted by commuters on Friday (24 Aug) evening which is said to be caused by a train fault at Pasir Ris station; SMRT has yet to announce the breakdown officially.

A commuter, Sherry Tan informed on TATA SMRT Facebook platform that the train service was delayed for 10 minutes at 6:25pm and it was due to track fault – announced via public announcement system in the station:

Sherry Tan wrote at 6:26pm: “Time 6.25pm : Additional 10 mins from Tanah Merah to Pasir Ris due to track fault.”

Sherry Tan wrote at 6:34pm: “Announced via pa system in station.”

On the same Facebook platform, other commuters also informed about the delay:

Wayne Chew posted at 6:40pm: “Train fault near Pasir Ris. Add 15 mins between Tanah Merah-Pasir Ris.”

John Robert Lee shared a post from MRT Singapore Service Information at 6:41pm, he wrote: “Faulty train at Pasir Ris, causing EWL Service to tailback all the way to Tanah Merah. +10 mins of travelling time expected.”

Passengers also questioned and complained about the crawling train service on Twitter; Apparently, announcements were not made on all affected trains and stations when the trains started to slow down along EWL – hence the confusion of the fault:

@SMRT_Singapore pls lah. No announcement or anything. What’s up

A commuter wrote an answer to MRT Singapore Service Information that the delay was not only between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris, but for all stations going East:

At 7:03pm the train was still reported to be disrupted – although apparently there was an announcement earlier that the fault at Pasir Ris was cleared – confusing the passengers:
