SINGAPORE â€” Preliminary investigations into the breakdown that occurred this morning (Nov 25) on the North South Line (NSL) have indicated that a traction power fault was behind it.

Early investigations indicate a power breaker located at Ang Mo Kio MRT station was damaged, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a media statement. But the exact cause of the incident is under investigation, it noted.

In light of the GCE A-level examinations taking place today, LTA said the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) was also informed of the arrangements and candidates were given the assurance that they would not be penalised for being late and be given the full duration for the examination.

At around 6am today, train services were halted from Yishun to Bishan stations. Free bus boarding and free shuttle services were activated by SMRT between the Yishun and Marina South Pier, while an additional free shuttle bus service was operated between Yishun and Bishan for the peak south-bound demand.

At 8.10am, the services resumed in both directions and at 9am, LTA said about 50 trains were running at a frequency of 2-3 minutes.
