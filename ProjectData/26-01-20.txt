Speed up escalators at MRT stations

Escalators at MRT stations used to travel at a uniform speed of 0.75m per second.

It appeared to me that elderly commuters largely coped well with this. 

The transport authorities announced in 2016 that escalators along the North-South and East-West Lines would run at dual speeds — 0.75m per second during peak hours and 0.5m per second during off-peak hours — as part of an escalator upgrading programme due to be completed by next year.  

The slower speed is to make it safer for seniors. 

Since escalator speeds at some stations were lowered to 0.5m per second during off-peak hours, I have noticed a trail of commuters on the escalators, in both directions.

The escalators are unbearably slow.

As a result, I have seen more commuters rush up or down to catch a train.

This constant stress from stomping on the escalators may explain why they break down more often than before.

Since the Land Transport Authority encourages elderly people to take lifts instead of escalators, escalator speeds should be restored to the original 0.75m per second during off-peak hours.

This is so as not to slow down commuters’ journeys.

Since many non-elderly and elderly commuters appear to have no issue taking escalators at the original speed, there is no need to slow them down.

At the same time, lift speeds at MRT stations should be increased since numerous lifts move slowly.

Barricades near escalators should also be removed to ease the flow of commuters.

Perhaps some staircases could also be converted to escalators to accelerate the movement of commuters. More often than not, staircases at MRT stations are underutilised.
