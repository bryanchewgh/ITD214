Third NSL MRT breakdown in a week on Tuesday morning

26 Apr 2016

On Tuesday morning, south-bound train service on the North-South Line was crippled for close to half an hour, the third disruption in less than a week.

South-bound train service on the North-South Line (NSL) was crippled for close to half an hour early Tuesday (April 26th) morning - the third time in less than a week that Singapore's oldest MRT line has suffered a disruption, reported The Straits Times. 

NSL operator SMRT said in a tweet at 6:31am that there was no service from Woodlands to Kranji stations, and advised commuters to seek alternative transport. It said in a subsequent tweet that the breakdown was due to a traction power fault, while free public and shuttle buses were activated at affected stations.

Normal service resumed about 18 minutes later at around 6:49am, according to SMRT. In its latest update at 7:20am, SMRT said some trains and stations were still crowded due to congestion.

In a statement on Facebook, SMRT apologised to commuters and said it was investigating the cause to determine if it was related to the disruption on Monday (April 25th) evening. Tuesday morning's disruption comes less than 12 hours after a power dip caused an unprecedented breakdown of train services along three MRT lines and one LRT line. 0
