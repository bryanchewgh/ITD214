26 Apr 2016


A power fault caused major train service disruptions during peak hour on three MRT lines and the Bukit Panjang LRT.

Train services on three MRT lines and the Bukit Panjang LRT were disrupted at peak hour on Monday (April 25th) night, reported The Straits Times. 

Train services were affected by a power trip at 7:53pm, according to SMRT, with more than 20 stations affected. Some MRT stations also experienced blackouts, reports from The Straits Times readers and on social media indicated.

The affected parts of the lines were Buona Vista to Joo Koon stations on the East-West Line, Jurong East to Kranji stations on the North-South Line and Caldecott to HarbourFront stations on the Circle Line. Services on the North-South East-West Lines resumed at 8:23pm, and services on the Circle Line resumed at around 9:20pm. Four trains on the Bukit Panjang LRT were stalled between stations and 150 passengers were asked to disembark, SMRT said. Services resumed at 9:47pm. 

The power trip was traced to a power dip at the Buona Vista power intake station. "We are currently investigating the cause of the power trip. We deeply apologise for the inconvenience caused," SMRT said.
