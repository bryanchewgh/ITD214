Sheen Lau wrote on her Facebook, “Is it wrong of me to request for #SMRT@SMRT to broadcast officially on all public channels whenever there is a train delay or breakdown defined by a delay of more than 5 minutes? It is not sufficient when you only announce it INSIDE the trains. Why am I answerable to my bosses for being late to work when I am supposedly & usually on time to work?”
