MRT train disruption between Punggol and Harbourfront stations this morning during rush hour on Oct 26, 2015.
THE Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) said on Monday that it has in place contingency plans to deal with a major train service disruption that may disrupt national examinations.

The announcement came after some students (less than 20 candidates) reported late at their schools or to other examination centres to sit their GCE O- or A-level examination papers due to the train disruption on Monday morning.

"We would like to assure examination candidates that they will not be penalised for being late if they have difficulties getting to their examination centres due to the major train service disruption. Candidates would be given the full duration of the paper,'' the SEAB said.

SEAB said most of the affected candidates arrived within 30 minutes from the start of the examination. These candidates were given the full duration of their papers.

It added that schools have been informed to advise candidates that in the event that they cannot reach their schools in time due to a train disruption, they can take the examination at other schools near the MRT stations.

A list of schools have been posted at the MRT stations and are also available on SEAB website. Private candidates have been informed through the instructions issued to them.

Candidates affected by major public transport service disruption are advised to inform their respective schools or examination centres. Schools and examination centres are prepared to accept affected candidates from other examination centres reporting to their centres under such situations.
