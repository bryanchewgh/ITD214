Commuters complained that the line had so many disruptions lately.

Twitter user, Swayne, asked SMRT why there has not been any staffs at the entrance to tell people that there is a breakdown. As commuters would not have to swipe the cards which made them waste their fare.

Meow said that she feels if the breakdown occurred during rush hour then commuters should be at least travelling for free.
