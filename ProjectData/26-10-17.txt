SMRT incident: Holding leaders accountable is not ‘politicising’ the issue

I refer to the letter, “Let’s not politicise transportation problem” (Oct 25), and beg to disagree with the writer.

Holding the Government and SMRT management accountable is not politicising the matter, but protecting the interests of Singaporeans.

The problems that have plagued our MRT network are almost a decade old.

It took us a decade to build an industrial estate out of a swamp, clean up filthy Singapore River, and build an award-winning airport. Yet, we continue to muddle with the problems affecting our train systems.

Granted, the assets are ageing and need replacement, but many of the issues are preventable, if there were proper management and maintenance.

Following the two major breakdowns in 2011, a Committee of Inquiry identified that those faults were preventable. Commitments were made in Parliament that SMRT would take preventive actions.

Since then, breakdowns have continued to occur, and no one has ever been held accountable for them.

No apologies were made until 16 Oct 2017.

SMRT management’s interests do not appear to be aligned with the commuters, and the Government has allowed them to continue. And, during all these times, our elected representatives in Parliament have been very silent.
