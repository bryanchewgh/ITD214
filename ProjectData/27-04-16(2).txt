Monday's major MRT breakdown caused by power fault

27 Apr 2016

According to the Land Transport Authority, Monday's train breakdown was due to a power fault in the western sector of the North-South and East-West Line.

Monday's train breakdown was due to a power fault within the western sector of the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL), said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Tuesday, reported The Straits Times. 

In reply to queries from The Straits Times, the LTA said, "Checks carried out during engineering hours indicated that the circuit breaker trip was not due to a power dip, but a power fault within the western sector of the NSEWL." A circuit breaker is a device that 'breaks' an electrical connection when there is high resistance, a surge or a stray current. When it trips, it cuts off the flow of electricity.

The LTA added that more checks will be carried out and that it is working with SMRT to find the root cause of the power faults. Preliminary investigations have found that the 22kV circuit breakers at Buona Vista station had tripped. 

The Buona Vista power intake station supplies power to the western sector of the NSEWL and parts of the Circle Line (CCL), said LTA, and hence affected train services on the NSEWL from Buona Vista to Joo Koon and Jurong East to Kranji, and the CCL from Harbourfront to Caldecott. "As the Bukit Panjang LRT system receives power from the same source through Choa Chu Kang on the NSEWL, it was similarly affected," it added.
