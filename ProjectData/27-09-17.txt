Chances are (if you're a plebeian like us and take the MRT), you would have experienced a train breakdown at least once by now.

If you're lucky, it's an additional "20 minutes" to your journey. If you're not so lucky, you'll find yourself breaking down along with the MRT.

Free rides in times of emergency
But now, some superheroes have started a MRT breakdown support group on Facebook. It's aptly called TATA SMRT, which stands for "The Alternate Transport Advisory & Singapore Magnificent Rescue Team". 

The group aims to create a pool of volunteer drivers who provide free rides in the event of a major breakdown â€” especially for students who are running late for exams. They also encourage car and cab pooling among commuters.

Real-time updates and advice on routes
Members can also post real-time updates on any service disruptions to the page or, even if you're not in the middle of a train breakdown, you can also ask for advice on transport routes. More often than not, these queries are answered promptly.





TATA SMRT welcomes everyone, even if you're not a frequenter of the MRT. Besides offering rides and advice, you can also help by creating publicity for the group and sending positive vibes to those who are stuck in a breakdown.

You can join them here.

However, if all you need is a clean, undisrupted feed of MRT status updates, you can also check out MRT OK.
