LTA reveals probe results on NEL system failure


28 Nov 2015


Two rail disruptions in October were electrical in nature, said the Land Transport Authority and SBS Transit in a joint statement released yesterday.

In a joint statement released yesterday, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and train operator SBS Transit (SBST) said they had completed investigations into what brought trains to a halt on Oct 13th and 26th, and that the two rail disruptions on the North-East Line (NEL) last month were electrical in nature, reported The Straits Times. 

On Oct 13th, train services were disrupted between Farrer Park and Hougang stations because of a malfunction of an electrical switchgear at a substation. Both parties will work at enhancing the power system of the 12-year old line, but did not say what this entails.

The breakdown, which happened during the morning rush hour, inconvenienced thousands of commuters, like the breakdown on the morning of Oct 26th. That day, a new train undergoing testing damaged the overhead catenary system (OCS) which supplies electrical power to trains. 

Investigations found that the new train, which was manually driven, was stopped immediately when the driver saw sparks from above. The train stopped at a stretch where the mainline and depot OCS wires overlapped, resulting in electrical arcing between the mainline and the depot OCS wires. Sustained arcing caused the OCS wires to melt and snap. The operator has marked all overlap zones on the tracks to indicate these are no-stopping zones.
