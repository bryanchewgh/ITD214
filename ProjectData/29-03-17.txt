Stomper Apple101 was travelling along Teck Whye Lane yesterday night (Mar 28) when he saw personnel from the Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) along the road next to Teck Whye Light Rail Transit (LRT) station. 

An LRT train on the Bukit Panjang LRT line had broken down in between Teck Whye and Phoenix stations, leaving passengers stranded. 

SMRT confirmed the breakdown in a tweet:

"[BPLRT]: No train service between BP1 and BP6. Community loop service still available. Free bridging bus service is available."

In the photos posted on Facebook by Myo Khine, the LRT train can be seen marooned on the tracks.

Passengers of the LRT train can also be seen walking on the tracks towards Teck Whye station, directed by SCDF personnel. 

LRT train services resumed at about 9.30pm, SMRT said in a subsequent tweet. 

Said the Stomper:

"This was my first time witnessing something like this happen, so naturally I was very shocked."
