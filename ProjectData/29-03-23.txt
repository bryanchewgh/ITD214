SINGAPORE – A 33-year-old woman was found dead on Thursday night at Cove station along the Punggol East LRT loop.

Transport operator SBS Transit announced on Twitter at about 10.30pm on Thursday that both the Punggol East and West LRT loops were down due to the incident. Services resumed on Friday morning.

The woman was found motionless on the LRT track near the station’s platform and was pronounced dead at the scene. Based on preliminary investigations, the police said they do not suspect foul play.

In response to queries from The Straits Times, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call for assistance at about 10pm.

Cove station, at 50 Punggol Field, is the first station in the Punggol East LRT loop.

Free bus services were deployed to ferry affected commuters.

In a Facebook post on Thursday, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, Member of Parliament for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, suggested commuters make alternative travel arrangements.


Photos she shared showed a police cordon set up at the LRT station, as well as an ambulance and fire engine.

Excluding the latest death, there have been five other track fatalities that have taken place at LRT stations since the mode of transportation was first started in 1999, said a spokesman for the Land Transport Authority on Wednesday (March 29).

It added that it was unable to comment further as police investigations were ongoing and also urged all parties to refrain from speculation.
