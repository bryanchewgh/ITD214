SINGAPORE: Train services on the Circle Line were delayed due to a train fault on Monday (Apr 29) morning, with commuters advised to add half an hour to their usual travel time.

The disruption lasted for about two hours, beginning with an alert by transport operator SMRT on Facebook at 6.09am that warned of a delay between Holland Village and Pasir Panjang stations.


The affected segment later extended to more stations.

"On Apr 29 at around 6.05am, due to a train fault, train services are affected," said SMRT in one of its updates on Facebook at 6.43am. 

"Commuters are advised to add up to 30 minutes of train travel time between Paya Lebar and HarbourFront MRT stations on the Circle Line."

In-train and station announcements were made to inform commuters about the situation. It added that free regular bus services were available from Paya Lebar station to HarbourFront station, and free bridging bus services were available from Paya Lebar station to Buona Vista station. 

Regular train services resumed progressively after 7.30am, before fully resuming just after 8.10am.
