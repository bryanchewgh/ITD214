Commuters on Singapore’s Circle Line were met with unexpected delays this morning following a train fault at 6:05 AM, which disrupted services and increased travel times by up to 30 minutes.

SMRT, the transport operator, reported the initial disruption on Facebook at 6:28 AM, indicating that the stretch between Bishan and One-North was impacted.


The disruption extended, with SMRT posting updates at 6:50 AM advising commuters to use alternative MRT lines at interchange stations such as Serangoon, Bishan, and Buona Vista.

At 6:54 AM, another update indicated that trains between Paya Lebar and One-North were also affected.



In response to the delays, SMRT implemented free regular and bridging bus services across affected routes to alleviate congestion and provide alternative transportation options between stations like Paya Lebar, HarbourFront, and Buona Vista.

SMRT issued an apology at 7 AM and reassured commuters that their engineers were working swiftly to fix the problem.

By 7:34 AM, train services were reported to be progressively returning to normal, though free bus services continued to operate to support the commuter flow.


Frustrations among commuters were evident on social media, with notable comments highlighting the severity of the disruption.

Dickson Tan expressed his irritation, saying, “Why are your trains still ending service at Tai Seng?? It is so packed at this peak hour!!” Jerome Fs added, “Why the f is the train reversing to another direction? Creating confusion. Signal display also not showing anything.”

Others pointed out broader issues with the system, with one netizen remarking, “Train fault at Holland Village but affected trains service is like half the loop” and another commenting, “Feel like the CCL signalling system performs worse compared to the EWL or even TEL tbh.”
