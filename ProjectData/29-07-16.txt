A 15-minute delay on the North-East Line has occured on Friday morning, as a result of a train fault at Buangkok station.

A train fault at Buangkok station caused a delay on the North-East Line on Friday (July 29th) morning.

SBS Transit which operates the line, said in a tweet at 7:31am that commuters should expect an additional 15 minutes of travelling time. Free bus rides were also deployed between Potong Pasir and Punggol stations.
