SINGAPORE: Train services on parts of the Circle Line were affected for around 14 hours on Friday (Sep 29), as engineers worked to replace a faulty section of the rail crossing.

The issue surfaced at about 2.30am during a routine maintenance inspection when a crack was detected on the rail track at the crossing from Promenade to Esplanade and Bayfront stations, according to transport operator SMRT.

Its first update on the disruption was posted at 5am. More than 12 hours later, at about 5.20pm, commuters were still being advised to transfer to the East-West Line and Downtown Line as part of their journeys. 

SMRT confirmed in an update at 7.31pm that the Circle Line was cleared, with train services resuming, and the end of free bus and bridging bus services.

The work resulted in slower train services for both ways from Dhoby Ghaut to Promenade stations and from Marina Bay to Stadium stations.

This is because trains had been diverted to one track to avoid the affected stretch, according to SMRT. 

The transport operator earlier advised commuters to factor in an additional travel time of 30 minutes along the affected stretch. It later urged commuters to transfer to the East-West Line and Downtown Line to continue their journey.

During the disruption, SMRT provided free bus services between Paya Lebar and Dhoby Ghaut stations, as well as between Paya Lebar and Marina Bay stations. It also put on bridging bus services between Paya Lebar and Promenade stations.
