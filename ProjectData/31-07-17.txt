Where’s the action plan to meet rail reliability goals?

Setting a reliability target without a corresponding action plan would be meaningless (Khaw raises bar for rail reliability, sets new target; July 28).

The Transport Ministry must demand that the operators come up with a set of steps to satisfy commuters that such a target will not be hot air.

When inadequate maintenance is pinpointed as the source of service disruptions, punitive measures must be enforced. The public has yet to hear what fines have been imposed on the operators for recent disruptions where causes have been identified.

Justice, rather than only a slap on the wrist, must be seen to be done. The “loose panel” that caused power trips is a case in point (LTA orders system-wide checks after loose door causes train delays; July 26).

Such an incident is not a problem of wear and tear. Rather, it points to carelessness on the part of personnel or a lack of excellence in maintenance.

In the case of the signalling tests, connecting the wrong radio to a live system smacks of unprofessionalism or carelessness. Fortunately, the mistake did not lead to severe financial costs or loss of life, but it frustrated thousands of commuters.

The Certificate of Entitlement was implemented to avoid the economic costs associated with traffic jams. Could the ministry estimate the accumulated cost of the MRT breakdowns?

Perhaps the ministry should advise the public on the budget for the new signalling system and what cost overruns have been incurred. That a replacement system should take over a year to be up and running is beyond my understanding.
